- Thanks for the `consultation`....
- That's why you have me for fashion `consultation`.
- Oh i see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy `consultation`.
- Okay, okay... we get a "personal `consultation`" with a make-up artist -- eeeh!
- In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full `consultation`.'
- As a matter of fact i did some free `consultation` for "mike" -- that's not his real name.
