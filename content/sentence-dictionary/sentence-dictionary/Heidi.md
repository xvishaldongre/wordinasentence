- `Heidi` - why didn't you come down here?
- I know you wouldn't need leon if `heidi` was treating you right.
- For god's sake don't start in on `heidi` again ... what's wrong with that?
- You become a stranger in your own home... `heidi`, for christ sake, shut up!
- The thing i don't understand is why you come out and sleep with `heidi` anyway?
