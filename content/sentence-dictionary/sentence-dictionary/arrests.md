- A record of the `arrests`... ...worst possible time for me.
- A and a, that's all you're interested in -- `arrests` and ass.
- Nothing so far from `arrests`, hospital admissions or coroners.
- Records of `arrests` for rape, especially by a man wearing green.
- Cross check- ing names from `arrests` for sexual offenses, public fondling.
- Anyway, she was a runaway, `arrests` for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit.
