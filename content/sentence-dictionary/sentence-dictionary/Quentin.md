- `Quentin`, how's your gear?
- Rob reiner and `quentin` tarentino?
- Scores to san `quentin` instead of stanford.
- Helen, on your lists to call is san `quentin`.
- She packed a bag to go and stay with mr. `quentin`.
- I did a minute in `quentin` for possession with intent.
- You bought yourself a return ticket to `quentin`, breaking and entering.
- Come on, `quentin`, isn't that pretty selfish, putting yourself ahead of the mission?
- I don't know why you're so weirded out, this is not san `quentin`, it's just a nuthouse.
