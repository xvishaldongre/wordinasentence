summary: "Zulu"

- Alternate lz `zulu` sierra at 0500.
- A multicultural `zulu` egalitarian?
- Romeo tango `zulu`, do you have the president?
- This is romeo tango `zulu` changing call signs.
- Tower, alert air traffic, romeo tango `zulu` is now air force one.
- I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks `zulu`.
- My only fear is that the `zulu` will avoid the engagement so attack is your defence.
